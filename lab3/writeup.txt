after running the gdb, here are the addresses:
return address: 0xbfffee18
buffer address: 0xbfffede0

the distance is : 0xbfffee18 - 0xbfffede0 = 56 + 4 = 60

Since we are using 32 bit system, we can add any multiple of 4 to the return address to estimate the absolute address.

In this case, adding 0x08 to return adress would give us the address 
to put out malicious code in: 
0xbfffee18 + 0x08 = 0xbfffee20
